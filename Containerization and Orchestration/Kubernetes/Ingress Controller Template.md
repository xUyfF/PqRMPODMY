## Ingress Controller Template

The Ingress controller is a critical component for managing external access to services in a Kubernetes cluster. It allows you to define accessible URLs, load balance traffic, terminate SSL/TLS, and offer name-based virtual hosting. This template guides you through setting up an Ingress controller like Nginx or Traefik, accompanied by basic routing rules.

### Ingress.yaml

Create an `Ingress.yaml` file with the following content to define your Ingress rules. Ensure to replace placeholder values (e.g., `<ingress-name>`, `<app-domain>`, `<service-name>`, `<service-port>`) with your actual service details.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: <ingress-name>
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
  - host: <app-domain>
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: <service-name>
            port:
              number: <service-port>
```

### Customization Instructions

- `<ingress-name>`: Name your Ingress resource.
- `<app-domain>`: Specify the domain name for accessing your application.
- `<service-name>`: The name of the Kubernetes service you want to expose externally.
- `<service-port>`: The port number of the service that the Ingress will route traffic to.

### How to Use

To deploy and utilize your Ingress configuration in a Kubernetes environment, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Ingress Configuration**: Edit the `Ingress.yaml` file, replacing all placeholders with your specific details tailored to your application's requirements.

2. **Apply the Ingress**: Deploy your Ingress to the Kubernetes cluster using the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f Ingress.yaml
    ```

3. **Verify the Ingress**: After applying the `Ingress.yaml`, ensure that the Ingress is correctly set up and routing traffic as expected:

    ```bash
    kubectl get ingress <ingress-name>
    ```

    This command will provide you with the IP address or URL through which you can access your application, based on the domain name and routing rules defined in your Ingress configuration.
